	<p class="lead">The pie chart above shows the distribution of dependency status of TAP (Tuition Assistance Program)
	recipients in the year 2016. It is obvious that majority of the students are dependent. Then there is a slight
	difference between independent students and students who are married but have no dependents with the latter being
	higher. The data from this graph has been collected from a trusted source students who are going to file TAP will
	find it useful.

	<p class="lead">The scatter plot above shows headcounts of TAP recipients between two year ranges. The blue plots
	represent students from year 2003 to 2008 and the orange plots indicate years from 2010 to 2015. It is quite surprising to
	see that highest number of students who recieved TAP is from year 2004 which is quite a long time ago. The lowest number
	is in the year 2015. It has begun to increase from the follwing years which the future students may find releiving.</p>
