			<h2>Article 1: The Changing Role of the Modern DBA – New Skills for Security</h2>
			<p><a href='http://select.ioug.org/p/bl/et/blogid=6&blogaid=887'>Go to the article</a></p>
			<p>Summary: Data is everywhere now and with its prevalence and dependency in almost every platform, extra care should be taken on how to protect it. As of now, protecting the data does not only mean creating users and managing authorizations. The modern DBA should acquire new skillset to deal with data. There are several factors why they should do so. First of all, they need to realize that data does not reside in the database only. It is used by many companies, business enterprises, and by many other third parties. Since the spectrum of the usage of data is much broader, DBA need to acknowledge, revise their policies on the data integrations. Another important factor is the “Depth of Security”.  The data we have out in public cloud databases and in other integrations are not secured. Additional layer of security needs to be implemented to get a better handle of that data flow and its usage. For example, timely report and monitoring of the data, communicating clearly with the security team time to time, grant access to data based on roles are some good steps for adding depth in data security.</p>

			<h2>Article 2: Machine Learning and Autonomous Databases</h2>
			<p><a href='http://www.dbta.com/Editorial/Think-About-It/Machine-Learning-and-Autonomous-Databases-122097.aspx'>Go to the article</a></p>
			<p>Summary: Integration of machine learning in different software has been a trend and it has saved a lot of time and effort put in by a human to accomplish a task. We can also think about a database being autonomous. In other words, a well-trained database that would take different actions based on circumstances. The difficult part is to make the system detect abnormal behavior in the database. How is it done is nicely described on the article. Basically, mathematical and statistical models are implemented on the system based that will be used by the system based on different situations.  For example, the system may use standard deviation in one case or percentile in another for calculation. These practices can be taught so that the system can make use of the appropriate methods in different circumstances.</p>

			<h2>Article 3: NHS 1.2 million patient name database hacked 'to expose weaknesses'</h2>
			<p><a href='https://www.scmagazineuk.com/nhs-12-million-patient-name-database-hacked-to-expose-weaknesses/article/683073/'>Go to the article</a></p>
			<p>Summary: Unauthorized access of the records of 1.2 million patients is another example of the carelessness behind building a secured database system. Even though the article mentioned that no medical records but only names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses have been accessed, things that can be done just using these information are endless. The article mentioned a person saying that the public has the right to know how big companies handle sensitive data and that the hack has revealed the weakness in the software created by the SwiftQueue company. I do not agree with this comment since revealing software practices/techniques to public will more like make the system prone to attack. But I do agree that some sort of clear high-level description needs to be broadcasted to the public for assurance. The article also mentions about hacking medical equipment. Different medical machines which are data driven such as X-ray machines that has access to patient’s radiation doses can also be tampered with. Such action could lead to serious consequence on a patient’s health. It becomes very easy for the attacker when the data stored is not encrypted (Phillips DoseWise Portal did that according to the article). This depicts another bad software practice in terms of storing sensitive records.  </p>
