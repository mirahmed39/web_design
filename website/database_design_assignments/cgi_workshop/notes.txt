steps

1. write the index.html file containing the <form> for user input
2. write a .css file for the .html file
3. upload the data to the server (this case we have a text file) and the .sql script
4. open sqlite
	a. create a .db file
	b. '.read' to execute the .sql script
	c. use .import to import the data into the database
	d. run a few queries to verify the data are imported correctly.
5. write the python script that the <form> calls on "action"
	a. fetch the form data
	b. attach the .css file
	c. open sqlite database
	d. create the query (which is a string in python)
	e. python passes the query to sqlite for it to be executed
	f. sql runs the query
	g. sqlite gives the result back to python
	i. python formats the output and renders the document for display
