## Holiday Application.

The date range is betweeen 9/1/2017 to 8/31/2018.

I should have a multidimensional array. Each element inside the array is another array which should contain the 

+ date object that corresponds to a holiday.
+ description of the holiday.
+ an image source related to the holiday.

When an user inputs a date, the javascript programs should create a date object using the input fetched from the date input field. Then it should search inside the multidimensional array for that date. If it finds it then display the holiday description and the corresponding image. If it does not find it then it means it is not a holiday and display the appropriate message.

The end.
